# Lebowski Front End

This is a simple Front-End built with React utilizing [Aaron Ackerman's](https://twitter.com/_aaronackerman_) amazing [Lebowski API](https://github.com/aackerman/lebowski-api)

To run locally:

- clone the repo
- `$ npm install`
- `$ npm start`

Currently, you will need a cors extension for use with chrome. I recommend:  [Allow-Control-Allow-Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi)
